# Rock Paper Scissors

1. Look in the js/main.js file for a function defined with the name "determineWinner" sans quotes

2. Implement the JavaScript code to take care of the cases where the computer wins

3. If the human players wins add a class called you-win to css/style.css making it obvious that the player has Won, perhaps a green
colour, large font size or other styling you deem appropriate

4. If the human player looses add a class called you-loose to css/style.css making it obvious that the player has lost 

5. In the event of a draw add a class called draw-game to css/style.css which indicates a neutral approach

## Optional

If we are feeling like this is even mildly interesting use some `CSS` to position the scoreboard in the top right of the page.  Absolutely positioned the div containing the 
table is fine.

We than need to write some JavaScript to keep score (remember *HINT variable)

Tidy up our JavaScript in the determineWinner function to make use of variables rather than hard coding values all the time
